This Next.js application with app router implements a store locator with separate routes for functionality and user interaction.

Home Route (page.js): This route displays the interactive store locator. Data for the stores is fetched using Next.js data fetching methods and displayed within the component. Loading and error states are handled gracefully using custom components (loading.js and error.js).
Form Route (form/page.js): This route provides a form for users to submit data. The form utilizes validation rules and error handling to ensure user input is correct.
Error Handling (error.js): A dedicated error handling component displays user-friendly messages based on errors encountered during application execution.
Loading State (loading.js): This component provides a visual indicator while data is being fetched or processed, ensuring a smooth user experience.
